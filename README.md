# cellular-simulation
A Python program that simulates cellular life using matrix-based rules. This project implements a custom cellular automaton where cells evolve based on the their neighbors' states across multiple time steps.

# Project Origins and Evolution (Disclaimer)
This project originated from a university course assignment but with significant refactoring and enhancement, such as:
- Modular design principles
- Enhanced user experience with clear prompts and feedback
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Option to re-run simulations with different parameters

# Technical Details
- Time Complexity: O(rows * cols) for each simulation step
- Space Complexity: O(rows * cols) for matrix storage
- Language: Python 3.6+
- Key Features: Menu-based user interaction, plane data editing, file input/output
